# Automated-Botanical-Catalog
This repository documents a project developed in collaboration with the University Botany Group, where we created a visual catalog of plant species that updates automatically from a connected database.

👉 We designed a system that:

📄 Uses Adobe InDesign as the layout platform

📊 Pulls structured information from an Excel-based dataset

🔄 Allows the content of each page (text, icons, images) to be updated with a single click

Automatically generates species cards like this one:

<p align="center">
  <img src="Ejemplo.PNG"/>
</p>

🧰 Tools used

    💻 InDesign	Layout design for the cards
    📈 Excel	Botanical data management
    🔁 Data Merge	Automated population of templates
    🧑‍🔬 Botany Group	Scientific content validation
    🎯 Outcomes
    ✅ Over 25 species cards generated automatically

✅ Easy to update or republish the catalog without manual formatting

✅ Works for both printed and digital outputs

📌 Why is it meaningful?
This project showcases the potential of combining editorial design with structured data to save time, reduce human error, and support science communication and education.
